# Ambient Email Agent – Codebase Review (2025-09-26)

## Overview
This note highlights the highest-impact follow-ups for reminders and the Agent Inbox. Items call out concrete risks or implementation gaps along with recommended remediation steps so the reminder feature can graduate from manual tooling and the Agent Inbox can handle live traffic reliably.

## Findings & Recommendations
1. **Agent Inbox formatter assumes dict-like tool args.**
   * `format_for_display` calls `.get` on `tool_call["args"]` without confirming the payload is a dict and unconditionally joins `attendees`. If Gemini returns `None`, a list containing `None`, or a bare string, the join raises and the Agent Inbox render fails.
   * **Recommendation:** Guard the formatting by coercing args to a dict, defaulting empty lists before `join`, and falling back to safe placeholders when values are missing. This also opens the door to add validation for unexpected shapes (e.g., logging when the LLM produces legacy schemas).【F:src/email_assistant/utils.py†L70-L113】

2. **Reminder CLI reaches into the SQLite store’s private internals.**
   * `scripts/reminder_worker.py` calls `store._connect()` to list reminders, which bypasses the abstraction and makes it harder to swap storage backends. Any change to the connection lifecycle (e.g., connection pooling, async migrations) will break the CLI silently.
   * **Recommendation:** Promote a public `iter_active_reminders()`/`list_reminders()` API on `ReminderStore`, or at minimum expose a read-only helper that returns rows. Update the CLI to rely on the new method to keep the encapsulation boundary intact.【F:scripts/reminder_worker.py†L35-L89】【F:src/email_assistant/tools/reminders.py†L55-L142】

3. **Reminder graph nodes remain unimplemented.**
   * `src/email_assistant/graph/reminder_nodes.py` still logs "not implemented" for create/cancel flows, so reminders never integrate with the main LangGraph plan.
   * **Recommendation:** Prioritise wiring these nodes into the agent—at least stubbing the state transitions and calling through to `ReminderStore`—so the S-class reminder feature moves beyond manual CLI usage.【F:src/email_assistant/graph/reminder_nodes.py†L1-L11】

## Task Breakdown
### Agent Inbox Hardening
- [ ] Implement resilient argument normalisation inside `format_for_display` so non-dict inputs and missing attendee lists cannot raise exceptions during inbox rendering.
- [ ] Add a regression-focused unit test (or extend an existing inbox test) that exercises malformed tool payloads, ensuring LangGraph 1.0 message updates still succeed when Gemini emits unexpected shapes.
- [ ] Capture logging/metrics for discarded fields to inform future schema migrations without interrupting the live HITL flow.

### Reminder Store & Worker Encapsulation
- [ ] Introduce a public read/query method on `ReminderStore` (e.g., `iter_active_reminders`) that hides SQLite details while supporting LangGraph durable checkpoints.
- [ ] Refactor `scripts/reminder_worker.py` to rely on the new method instead of `_connect()`, keeping the worker compatible with future backend swaps or async LangGraph stores.
- [ ] Backfill integration coverage that drives the worker through reminder creation → listing → completion using the live ReminderStore implementation.

### LangGraph Reminder Nodes
- [ ] Flesh out `create_reminder` and `cancel_reminder` nodes so they write through the store, emit durable state transitions, and register within the compiled graph used by HITL agents.
- [ ] Validate the new nodes via an end-to-end reminder flow test (ideally live) that confirms reminders surface in the Agent Inbox and respect LangGraph 1.0 durability guarantees.
- [ ] Document the expected environment variables (`REMINDER_*`, `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_*`) needed for live testing so agents can spin up reminder coverage without manual spelunking.

## Testing Notes
- `pytest tests/test_judges.py --maxfail=1` *(fails: missing dependency `langchain_core` in base image).*【23a4fb†L1-L16】
